/**
In an unsorted array, the insert operation is faster compared to a sorted array because we dont have to care about the position at which th element is to be placed.

Javascript program to implement insert 
operation in an unsorted array. 

Function to insert a given key in the array. This function returns n + 1 if insertion is successful, else, n.

    // cannot insert more elements if n is already more than or equal to capacity.
    if (n >= capacity)
